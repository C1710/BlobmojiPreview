# BlobmojiPreview
A small EmojiCompat implementation to show emojis on Android devices

This is a very small app showcasing the possibilities of [EmojiCompat](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/emoji-compat.html) using the [Blobmoji](https://github.com/c1710/blobmoji)-Emoji-fork.
It can be used to show emojis which are not present on the device used.
